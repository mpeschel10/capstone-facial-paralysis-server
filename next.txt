Test reclaiming an existing instance without deleting it
    that is, delete local ssh key
Think through permutations of failure states
Startup script does not handle case where we have a key down here but that key is not uploaded
Thorough test (no project, no nothing)
Make the ssh invocations not require the user to retype their password fifty times
